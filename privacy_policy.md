## Privacy Policy

**Effective date: 12 May 2025**  
_Last updated: 29 Jun 2025_

By installing and using **GeldPlan** (“**App**”, “we”, “us”, “our”) you agree to this Privacy Policy.

### 1. Data We Store **Locally** Only

We do **not** send your personal or financial data to any server.  
Items you enter — income, expenses, budgets, notes, statistics—are saved **solely on your device**.

### 2. Optional Back-Ups

* The App can export a backup file to a location you pick (internal storage, SD-card, or a third-party cloud drive such as Google Drive or Dropbox).
* Restoring simply reads that file back.
* We never see or transmit these files.
* The Storage permission is requested **only** for backup import/export.
* Exported backup files are stored **as-is** (not encrypted) in the location you choose.  
  If you need extra protection, save the file inside an encrypted folder or cloud drive.
* **Third-party cloud services** have their own privacy and security practices.  
  When you save a backup to such a service, its handling of the file is governed by that provider’s privacy policy (e.g. Google Drive Privacy Policy, Dropbox Privacy Policy).


### 3. In-App Purchases

The App offers paid features processed by **Google Play Billing**.
* Google Play may share a **purchase token** with the App so it can recognise Premium status.
* We do not receive your card details or any personal payment information.  
  See Google’s [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for details.

### 4. Advertising & Consent

The free tier may display ads provided by **Google AdMob**.
AdMob may collect:

* Advertising ID
* IP address & coarse location
* Device information (model, OS version)

We use Google’s **User Messaging Platform (UMP)** to obtain your consent for personalised or non-personalised ads (where legally required).
You can change or withdraw your consent anytime via **Settings → About & Help → Privacy options** in the App.
Ad data is used according to your consent and your Google Play Store ad preferences.
Learn more in [Google AdMob & AdSense Privacy](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads).

### 5. Crash & Diagnostics (Android Vitals)

If the user has enabled **“Share usage & diagnostics with Google”** in Android settings, the
operating system may automatically send anonymised crash logs to Google Play.
GeldPlan receives **aggregated, de-identified stack traces only**; we cannot see personal
information or link a crash to a specific user.

You can turn this Android feature off at any time in  
Settings ▸ Google ▸ Usage & diagnostics.


### 6. How the App Uses Your Data

On-device data is processed **only** to:
* show your entries on the calendar,
* calculate balances and statistics,
* unlock paid features after a valid purchase token is received.

GeldPlan provides general budgeting tools and **does not** offer financial advice.

### 7. Your Control

* **Local data** — delete inside the App or by uninstalling it.
* **Backup files** — delete manually from the storage location you chose.
* **Ads personalisation** — change anytime in Google Settings › Ads, and you can revisit the consent form via App **Privacy Options**.
* **Diagnostics** — Android usage & crash reports are managed by your system settings.


### 8. Security

We use Android-level sandboxing plus optional biometric / PIN lock (if enabled in settings).

### 9. Children’s Privacy

The App is intended for users aged **13 and older**. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

### 10. Your Rights

Because we do not store your data on our servers, requests for access, correction or erasure generally concern only Google Play purchase records.  
Contact us and we will assist within 30 days.

### 11. Changes

Future updates to this policy will appear inside the App and on our website. Continued use after a change means you accept the new terms.
